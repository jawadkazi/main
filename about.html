The common life has changed drastically, and the changes that we are observing around us today, many of us had not even imagined about this in the past. Say, it’s the reduced levels of pollution or the way all the nations are collaboratively standing against the pandemic without the urge of dominance. Everything has changed, locally, and internationally as well! It’s impact ranges from dismantling economies, healthcare, and society as a whole.
            In this pandemic, even the greatest economies and powers are trembling and falling. More than over 1.5 million of the human population has fallen prey to this global threat. America lost the most number of lives rounding above 20,580 deaths, and cases rounding to 533,115. Spain is losing its human resource at the quickest rate of 346 cases from the country per 100,000 cases in the world. It is followed by Italy, with a net figure of 244 per 100,000. Respectively, these countries saw the deaths of 16,972 and 19,648 people in their country. While the American and European subcontinents seem to be worstly affected, meanwhile in Asian region, Russia and India are going through the stage where cases are doubled every 3 days. While these countries situated miles apart are going through massive loss, China, where the first cases of coronavirus were reported, has knocked the virus, and reported only 3,339 deaths and 82,052 cases in its national boundary. The long term social caused by COVID-19 can be attributed to unprecedented levels of xenophobic behavior, economic strain, and global panic.
